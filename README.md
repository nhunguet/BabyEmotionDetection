# Sever for Baby Emotion Detection Using Flask (Just project for fun ) 
Baby Emotion Detection
#The Problem: Using AI to determine children's Emotions, deploy on the web by using Flask 



#I observed the steps:

1- Data collection (~300 images for the Happy, sad, angry baby), you can improve by collecting more data from another source

2- Train model AI (I use CNN), and save the model which we were trained. 

=> We have the file model.h5

3- Deploy to the server (using Flask+front End web). 

This is a result sample!
