# Sever for Baby Emotion Detection Using Flask
Baby Emotion Detection
#The Problem: Using AI to determine children's Emotions, deploy on web by using Flask 



#I following the steps:

1- Data collection (~300 images for the Happy, sad, angry baby), you can improve by collect more data from other source

2- Train model AI (I use CNN), save the model which we was trained. 

=> we have the file model.h5

3- Deploy to the server (using Flask+front End web).
